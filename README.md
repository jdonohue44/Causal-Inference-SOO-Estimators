# Causal Inference Selection of Observables (SOO) Estimators

## Introduction
In this exercise, I implement various estimators under the selection on observables (SOO) design using a simulated data set. 

## Estimators
- Estimator 0: Unadjusted means
- Estimator 1.1: Regression adjustment with full control variables
- Estimator 1.2: Regression adjustment with partial control variables
- Estimator 2.1: Conditioning on propensity score with full control variables
- Estimator 2.2: Conditioning on propensity score with partial control variables
- Estimator 3.1: Re-weighting based on propensity score with full control variables
- Estimator 3.2: Re-weighting based on propensity score with partial control variables
- Estimator 4.1: Blocking based on propensity score with full control variables
- Estimator 4.2: Blocking based on propensity score with partial control variables
- Estimator 5.1: Doubly robust estimator with full control variables
- Estimator 5.2: Doubly robust estimator with partial control variables
